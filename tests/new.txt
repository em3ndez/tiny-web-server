Given an inlined Cuppa application
    When the endpoint can extract parameters
      ✓ Then it should extract parameters correctly from the path
      ✓ Then it should return 404 when two parameters are provided for a one-parameter path
    When the endpoint can extract query parameters
      ✓ Then it should handle query parameters correctly
    When an application exception is thrown from an endpoint
      ✓ Then it should return 500 and an error message for a runtime exception
    When the endpoint has query-string parameters
      ✓ Then it should parse query parameters correctly
    When response headers are sent to the client
      ✓ Then it should set the custom header correctly
    When an exception is thrown from a filter
      ✓ Then it should return 500 and an error message for a runtime exception in a filter
    When testing static file serving
      ✓ Then it should serve a static file correctly
      ✓ Then it should return 404 for a non-existent static file
      ✓ Then it should prevent directory traversal attacks
    When accessing a nested path with parameters
      ✓ Then it should extract parameters correctly from the nested path
      ✓ Then it should return 404 for an incorrect nested path
  When using standalone TinyWeb.SocketServer without TinyWeb.Server
    ✓ Then it should echo three messages plus -1 -2 -3 back to the client
  When using TinyWeb.SocketServer with TinyWeb.Server and a contrived webSocket endpoint
    ✓ Then it should echo three modified messages back to the client (twice)
  When passing attributes from filter to endpoint
    ✓ Then the attribute user should be passed from filter to endPoint for authentic user
    ✓ Then the attribute user should not be passed from filter to endPoint for inauthentic user
  When applying filters
    ✓ Then it should allow access when the 'sucks' header is absent
    ✓ Then it should deny access when the 'sucks' header is present
    ✓ Then it can access items outside the path

WARNING: Unable to find an exact match for CDP version 130, returning the closest version; found: 129; Please update to a Selenium version that supports CDP version 130
    ✓ Then it should echo three messages plus -1 -2 -3 back to the client
  When endpoint and filters can depend on components
    ✓ Then it should be able to get dep to function
    ✓ Then it should not be able to depend on items outside request scope
  Given a TinyWeb server with an SSE endpoint
    ✓ Then it should receive server-sent events
  Given a mocked ExampleApp
    When accessing the Greeting GET endpoint
Mockito is currently self-attaching to enable the inline-mock-maker. This will no longer work in future releases of the JDK. Please add Mockito as an agent to your build what is described in Mockito's documentation: https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#0.3
WARNING: A Java agent has been loaded dynamically (/home/paul/scm/tinywebserver/test_libs/byte-buddy-agent-1.15.4.jar)
WARNING: If a serviceability tool is in use, please run with -XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading to hide this warning

Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: Sharing is only supported for boot loader classes because bootstrap classpath has been appended
      ✓ Then it should invoke the ExampleApp foobar method
  Given a TinyWeb server with composed paths
    ✓ Then it should respond correctly to requests at the composed endpoint
  Given a TinyWeb server with ConcreteExtensionToServerComposition
    When that concrete class is mounted within another path
      ✓ Then endPoints should be able to work relatively
