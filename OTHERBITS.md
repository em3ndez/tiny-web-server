# Other Features of TinyWeb

## WebSocket Support

TinyWeb provides built-in support for WebSockets, allowing for real-time communication between the server and clients. This is achieved through the `SocketServer` class, which can handle WebSocket connections and messages.

## Path-Based Routing

TinyWeb supports path-based routing, allowing developers to define endpoints with specific paths and methods. This enables the creation of RESTful APIs with ease.

## Static File Serving

TinyWeb can serve static files from a specified directory. This is useful for serving assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from the server.

## Filters

Filters in TinyWeb allow for pre-processing of requests. They can be used for tasks such as authentication, logging, or modifying requests before they reach the endpoint.

## Dependency Management

TinyWeb includes a simple dependency management system that allows for the instantiation and caching of components. This can be used to manage application-wide or request-specific dependencies.

## Error Handling

TinyWeb provides mechanisms for handling errors both at the server level and within application logic. This includes customizable error responses and logging.

## Statistics and Monitoring

TinyWeb can collect and record statistics about requests, such as response times and status codes. This information can be used for monitoring and optimizing application performance.

## Integration with Testing Frameworks

TinyWeb is designed to be easily testable, with support for integration with testing frameworks like Cuppa and Mockito. This allows for comprehensive testing of web applications built with TinyWeb.

## Lightweight and Self-Contained

TinyWeb is a lightweight framework that does not rely on external dependencies, making it easy to integrate into projects and deploy.

## License

TinyWeb is licensed under the MIT License, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution of the software.
