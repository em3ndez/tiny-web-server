# WebSocket Messaging Patterns and Frameworks

A breakdown of the common WebSocket messaging patterns and frameworks that demonstrate them well:

## Key WebSocket Messaging Patterns:

### 1. Request/Response

The most basic pattern where a client sends a request and server responds directly
Similar to HTTP but maintains persistent connection
Good for real-time queries and commands

### 2. Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

Clients subscribe to topics/channels
Publishers send messages to topics
All subscribed clients receive messages
Excellent for broadcasting updates, notifications, chat systems

### 3. Push Notifications

Server initiates communication to send updates to clients
Often used for real-time alerts, live feeds, status updates

### 4. Event Sourcing

All changes are stored as a sequence of events
Clients can replay events to rebuild state
Useful for audit trails and state synchronization

# Here are some notable frameworks by language that implement these patterns well

## Frameworks by Language

### JavaScript/Node.js:

Socket.IO: Excellent for pub/sub and push notifications
ws: Low-level WebSocket library
Primus: Abstraction layer supporting multiple transport protocols

### Python:

FastAPI with WebSockets: Good for request/response
Channels (Django): Robust pub/sub implementation
aiohttp: Async WebSocket support

### Java:

Spring WebSocket: Complete implementation of all patterns
Vert.x: Reactive WebSocket implementation
Apache ActiveMQ: Message broker with WebSocket support

### Go:

Gorilla WebSocket: Low-level but powerful
Centrifugo: Real-time messaging server with pub/sub

### Rust:

tokio-tungstenite: Async WebSocket library
actix-web: Web framework with WebSocket support

# Session Management Across HTTP and WebSocket

1. **Cookies**:
   - Most frameworks support using cookies to maintain session state. The HTTP server sets a session cookie, which is then sent by the client during the WebSocket handshake.

2. **URL Parameters**:
   - Some applications pass session tokens as URL parameters during the WebSocket handshake. This is less secure than cookies but can be used in certain scenarios.

3. **Initial Handshake**:
   - During the WebSocket handshake, session information can be passed using query parameters or cookies. This requires server-side support to extract and validate the session data.

4. **Token-based Authentication**:
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or other token-based systems can be used to authenticate WebSocket connections. The token is sent as part of the handshake request and validated by the server.

5. **Shared Session Store**:
   - Both HTTP and WebSocket servers can access a shared session store (e.g., Redis, database) to retrieve session information using a session ID or token.

These methods ensure that session information is consistently available across both HTTP and WebSocket connections, allowing for seamless user experiences.
